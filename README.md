After spending the past 5 years working in primary education I have been trying to find a career that is more engaging, I believe I have found that calling in becoming a developer. I have spent the last year moving towards this goal, culminating in attending a 4 month intesive bootcamp at Makers Academy.

I'm looking to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution. I'm a fast learner, and I'm willing and enthusiastic to learn new technology stacks and skills.



**Background**

- **Primary Education**

     5 years of experience in a classroom environment, focussing on working with children on the SEN spectrum.

- **Technical Experience**

     During my time at the school I became the in-house IT support person after we lost our system admin due to budgetary cuts, I also ran a club teaching basic programming using MIT's Scratch.

- **Customer Service**

     9+ years experience working in the catering industry in both front-of-house customer service and kitchen roles.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career I have always worked in environments built on the ability to make yourself understood. Whether explaining a lesson to children in the classroom, conflict resolution on the playground, debating on how to implement the curriculum with my colleagues or helping staff work through their technical difficluties.

Whilst at Makers Academy I feel I have grown further in my abilities during pair programming sessions and working on group projects, I have become more confident speaking out in meetings and making sure I can add my experience to situations that demand it.

#### Passion for learning

During my time working in education, my focus was always on how I could best teach others and in turn this taught me a lot about how I learn myself. During the lead-up to my decision to change my career, I pushed myself to learn as much as I could about the different approaches I could take to get into the software industry. I spent some time working on programming courses and kata to get a better understanding of programming before the intensive immersion I would experience while attending the bootcamp.

#### Problem Solving

My love of problem solving has grown exponentially since I started programming. While previously I would have scratched this itch playing boardgames, I now revel in working my way out of a difficult debugging problem, or researching how to best go about utilising a technology.
